	<p>As an undergrad at the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of Pennsylvania</a> I did not know what I  wanted to do after school until I worked as a security intern at 
	<a href="http://www.accenture.com" target="_blank">Accenture</a>.  After that summer I focused my remaining course work and research time into Computer/Information Security.  It was a move 
	that would serve me well in my career.</p>
	<p>I was a consultant and professional software developer for about six years after I finished my undergraduate degree from the <a href="http://www.upenn.edu" target="_blank">University of 
	Pennsylvania</a>. As my professional life flourished I developed a talent for solving business problems by devising creative solutions that leverage existing code modules and/or technology. 
	This does not mean I only worked on modifying existing systems, far from it. I helped design and build a very large Single Sign On system for a large government entity, as well as many 
	large independent add-ons to other web systems. I also developed/configured extensions for different large out-of-the-box (OOTB) systems for clients. I managed and produced deliverables in
	 all phases of the standard software development life cycle, from design through implementation and support/training. I worked on highly visible client engagements and delivered assets that have 
	 resulted in reduced development time, cost, and risk while increasing quality and user satisfaction.<br>I have had the pleasure to work for Accenture, Deloitte &amp; Touch LLC, and Tick Data, 
	 Inc.. While I was toiling away in the digital coal mines I specialized in: Object Oriented Development and Design, Identity and Access Management Design and Implementation, and Online Store 
	 Management.</p>
	<p>I left the workforce to pursue my Master's Degree for two main reasons: I wanted to learn more about the fundamental aspects of Computer Science and I believed that I had reached a point
	in my work life where I would be able to best leverage what I learned. I am excited to use my skills acquired over the past 6 years in my graduate studies, and even more 
	excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
