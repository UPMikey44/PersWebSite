	<h3>06/2007 - 10/2010</h3>
	<p><a href="http://www.accenture.com" target="_blank">Accenture</a> was a great place to start my career.  I met really interesting people, a large number I'm still friends with, I got to do interesting work, and they had awesome HHs and parties.  It was really all I could have asked for coming out of college.</p>

		<h3>What I learned</h3>
		<p>At <a href="http://www.accenture.com" target="_blank">Accenture</a> I was able to start off my career using Out-of-the-Box (OOTB) tools to help a company better secure access to
		their data. I was able to learn a lot and work with some really fantastic people that trusted me to do my work, as freshly graduated kid this meant a lot to me. I built some great tools
		and then went on to government consulting.  Here I worked with some more great people and worked on my biggest single project, a built from scratch <a href="http://gateway.usps.com" target="_blank">
		Identity and Access Management</a> tool, the page looks way fancier than when I initially put it together using MS Paint. Although we didn't have to build the user database.  I then moved
		 onto to another project and from there moved away from Accenture.</p>
