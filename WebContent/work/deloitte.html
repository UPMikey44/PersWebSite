	<h3>10/2010 - 12/2011</h3>
	<p>My last consulting gig before I left 'the industry.'  I worked with and met a lot of really nice people at <a href="http://www.deloitte.com" target="_blank">Deloitte &amp; Touche LLC</a>.</p>

		<h3>What I learned</h3>
		<p>At <a href="http://www.deloitte.com" target="_blank">Deloitte</a> I was able to work with a new IAM tool, <!-- Make this a link to ITIM -->IBM Tivoli Identity Manager.  It was useful
		to see how another tool allowed for IAM configuration.  I also worked with WebFOCUS, a tool used to create reports and pull data sets from different systems.<br>As I completed my tasks
		I was able to see first hand how important communication and networking is. Clearer definitions at different points during our development cycle would have greatly reduced headaches and
		the number of 'late' nights. The personal relationships I had developed over that time however helped to mitigate further disaster however as people were willing to help out the project
		I worked on when they might have otherwise found more pressing work to do.</p>
