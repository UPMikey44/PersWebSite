		<h2>Family and Friends</h2>
		<p>I'm married to Prakshi O'Connor, in the picture up there, who I met as an undergrad at Penn.  She's extremely awesome and is ok with supporting me as I pursue my graduate education, what else do I really need?<br/>Not much really but I have a great family; Father-in-law, Dad, Mom, Mother-in-law, younger sister, brother-in-law, younger sister, and a little brother (sorted by age).  I also got a mess of friends, an appropriate description of them I assure you, and extended family that help me enjoy life.</p>
