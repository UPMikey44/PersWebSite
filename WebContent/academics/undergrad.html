		<h3>Undergraduate Studies</h3>
		<p>I completed my Bachelor's in Science and Engineering Computer Science Engineering in 2007, with a minor in 
		Mathematics. As an undergrad at the University of Pennsylvania I was very interested in Compilers, and then some Computer Architecture after CSE 240/371, until my internship at 
		<a href="work/accenture.html">Accenture</a>.  That got me interested in Computer Security and I was able to parlay that into a cool, to Gerry and I at least, 
		<a href="images/Poster.pdf">Senior Design Project</a>. It boiled down to creating a program that translates a specially annotated Java source code into Java Smart Card and terminal code
		which would allow the Smart Card program to send a request to the terminal, and wait for a response.  The full paper is available here: 
		<a href="images/SNRDSNFINAL_RV4.doc">Refactoring the Java Card Framework</a>.</p>
		<h3>Interesting School Work (that not every CSE major does)</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Classroom Object-Oriented Language (COOL) Compiler</li>
			<li><a href="images/ese350/350.ppt">8 Significant Digit Hardware Calculator</a></li>
			<li><a href="images/math350/MathEssay.doc">Paper on Quadratic Reciprocity</a> (I think Number Theory is cool)</li>
			<li><a href="images/documentation.doc">Secured Distributed Banking</a></li>
		</ul>
