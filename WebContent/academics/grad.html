		<h3>Graduate Studies</h3>
		<p>As a graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, back after a short break in the working world, I am currently interested in Computer Security and Compilers. I left the workforce to pursue my 
		Master's Degree for two main reasons: I wanted to learn more about the fundamental aspects of Computer Science and I believed that I had reached a point in my work life where I would be able to best 
		leverage what I learned going forward. I am excited to use my skills acquired over the past 6 years in my graduate studies, and even more excited about the possibilities that lie ahead.<br>My course load 
		for the semester is: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/upenncis534/" target="_blank">CIS 640</a>: Advanced Topics in Software Systems: Concurrent Programming, 
		<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis511/" target="_blank">CIS 511</a>: Introduction to The Theory of Computation, 
		<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis551/" target="_blank">CIS 551</a>:Computer &amp; Networked Security.  I hope to see you around campus.</p>
